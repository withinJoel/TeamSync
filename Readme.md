# To get started
* Create a database
```
CREATE DATABASE teamsync;
```
* Enter inside the database
```
USE teamsync_db;
```

* Create a table called `department`

```
CREATE TABLE department (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

* Create a table called `employee`
```
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  department_id BIGINT,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(id)
);
```
* Create a table called `project`
```
CREATE TABLE project (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  employee_id BIGINT,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employee(id)
);
```

spring.application.name=teamsync
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/teamsync  //replace teamsync with your database name.

spring.datasource.password=test123!  //mysql password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
